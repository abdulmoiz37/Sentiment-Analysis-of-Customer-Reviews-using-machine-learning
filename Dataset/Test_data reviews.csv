" ""I hope a lot of people hear this cd We need more strong and positive vibes like this Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness Her blues is from the gut The pop sounds are catchy and mature"","
" ""I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fadeThe price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny"","
"Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight, not too loosegarment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care),"
" ""A complete waste of time Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book"","
"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealerIf you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediateHere everything is dull, dark, and clouded Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visualsAfter that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE Somewhere \out there\"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reelJust none of them appear to be on Amazon"","
" ""The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid"","
" ""If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"","
