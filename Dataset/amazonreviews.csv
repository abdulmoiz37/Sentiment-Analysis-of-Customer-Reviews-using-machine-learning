2,India," I hope a lot of people hear this cd We need more strong and positive vibes like this Great vocals, fresh tunes, cross-cultural happiness Her blues is from the gut The pop sounds are catchy and mature,","Inspiring, ",5
3,India," I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fadeThe price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny,","The best soundtrack ever to anything, ",5
4,India," The music of Yasunori Misuda is without question my close second below the great Nobuo UematsuChrono Cross OST is a wonderful creation filled with rich orchestra and synthesized sounds While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous Some of my favourite tracks include","\Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World\,",4
5,India," Probably the greatest soundtrack in history! Usually it's better to have played the game first but this is so enjoyable anyway! I worked so hard getting this soundtrack and after spending [money] to get it it was really worth every penny!! Get this OST! it's amazing! The first few tracks will have you dancing around with delight (especially Scars Left by Time)!! BUY IT NOW!!,","Too good to be true, ",5
6,India," There's a reason this CD is so expensive, even the version that's not an importSome of the best music ever I could listen to every track every minute of every day That's about all i can say,"," There's a reason for the price, ",5
7,India," This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \worst book\ contest I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \To Kill a Mockingbird\--a book I am quite sure Ms Haddon never heard of Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!,"," Buyer beware, ",1
8,India," I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway I have to say I love it I couldn't put it down I read the whole book in two hours I say buy it I say read it It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today We spend too much time looking at the faults of others I also enjoyed belovedSincerly,Jaylynn R,"," Errors, but great story, ",4
9,India," A complete waste of time Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book,","The Worst!, ",1
10,India," I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one All others beware! It is absolute drivel I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt Wait - maybe I'm missing the point A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes Phew, so glad I didn't waste $1095 after all,"," Oh please, ",1
11,India," I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \lean\ on her house I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling Please don't waste your money I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!,"," Awful beyond belief!, ",1
12,India," When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about \BY THE SEA\ This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!,"," A romantic zen baseball comedy, ",4
13,India," Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight, not too loosegarment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care),"," Lower leg comfort for 12 hours +, ",5
14,India," It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings The Sun Bronze pair fits okay but quality is less than the pair I bought at an actual compression store,"," Delivery was very long wait, ",3
15,India," sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart I tried to put it and sheer it! I guess you should not buy this item in the internetit is better to go to the store and check it,"," sizes recomended in the size chart are not real, ",2
16,India," Full of intrigue and a good overview of the court of James 1 and the key players Provides a good general history of all the facts of the case,"," Overbury, ",3
17,India," Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealerIf you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediateHere everything is dull, dark, and clouded Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visualsAfter that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE Somewhere \out there\ is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reelJust none of them appear to be on Amazon,"," Another Abysmal Digital Copy, ",1
18,India," Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's \Generation X\ Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of \Western culture\ - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them,"," Wardell's book is a pure delight, ",4
19,India," I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like \blue angel\,\lanna\ and 'mama\ the hair just rose off my neckRoy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days,"," i liked this album more then i thought i would, ",4
20,India," I wrote a harsh review based on hearing a couple of tracks from one album,but after hearing tracks from the other 3 albums,I have to say that I take it back and in fact I bought itThe other albums are very good value for money with good liner notes and some very good musicWell worth the money for Roy Orbison fans,"," Better than I thought, ",3
21,India," When I saw the term 'bootleg' on the title of this recording,I can see what they mean because one cd does have a slightly disappointing sound,but the others do sound much betterHaving seen the great Roy Orbison twice live in concert,I know that he sounded better,but overall it is a good value for money 4cd set with good liner notes,"," The great Roy Orbison deserves a better quality recording , ",3
22,India," I have had the charger for more than two years It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around You know how painful that is,"," Problem with charging smaller batterys, ",2
23,India," Greetings Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET Good bye,"," CHECK OUT THE K6000 CHARGER!, ",5
24,India," These will more than pay for themselves, they are perfect for my GPS which will drain a cheap battery in less than an hourbtw the charger did come with 1850 batteries,"," ahhh, ",5
25,Chennai," This is an excellent product I bought this for my digital camera It has a great battery life per charge Charger is handy to carry,"," Excellent Product, ",5
26,Chennai," I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while The design is nice and convenient However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power,"," Batteries died within a year , ",1
27,Chennai," You said \but the charge only lasts a very short time\Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity This may be your problem Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised,"," To \Disappointed\ in Miami, ",5
28,Chennai," It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot This book just makes you very, very happy For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica I only wish we had had that book ten years before So I do highly recommend it Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book Believe me It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro) Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 40 This book saved my ass Let it save yours too It's making me happy Thank you so much, Armando Greetings from Germany, Cologne,"," Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book, ",5
29,Chennai," After reading several reviews on this item, I purchased it as a Christmas gift My brother liked it a lot, so I decided to get one for my wife and me I'm really glad I did It's pretty easy to set up and use, and the playback is excellent in both the VCR and DVD modes The remote also operates my JVC TV This is a great choice if you're looking for a quality combination player from a trusted name in electronics,"," Excellent choice for combination, ",4
30,Chennai," This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice I agree with the easy set-up It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of itTwo comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)but those are my only complaints This is a good product for your $$$,"," Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!, ",4
31,Chennai," Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape This stuff may seem trivial Anyway, that's my two cents,"," Good player but wish I could change a few things, ",3
32,Chennai," I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality I'm giving up JVC after this as well I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot,"," DVD Player crapped out after one year, ",2
33,Chennai," I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select \random\ playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back The DVD playback is awesome The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality,"," Very Happy - Has \Random\ capability for MP3s, ",5
34,Chennai," This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious) JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS   shame they couldn't do better here,"," Great DVD, mediocre VCR, ",3
35,Chennai," Many useful concepts of digital compression can be found in this book It is easy to read and understand, especially for students and engineers in EE,"," This is a very good book for students and engineers, ",5
36,Chennai," This book appears to be a \print on demand\ style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the \muddy\ look of the text The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print That said, the actual content is very comprehensive One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing,"," Comprehensive but marred by poor printing, ",3
37,Chennai," It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality This is not a calculus book If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printingWith respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field,"," Great reference book for its topic, ",5
38,Chennai," It seems that authors have pictures unrelated to content of the text repeatedly printed It does not cover major topics, such as gif/ graphic file compression On the positive side it is well-written, organized, multiple equation in some chapters, descriptive in others Very little mathematical proof,"," large volume,not enough proof, introductory, good organizati, ",4
39,Chennai," The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid,"," should be titled \Hollywood Debacle\, ",1
40,Chennai," After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are If you enjoy a fitting but bleak ending, stop at Season 3, Episode 5 But if you prefer romantic comedies, view through 3/5 then skip to Season 4, Episode 3, as the final act,"," Here is a little secret, ",5
41,Chennai," I love this show, however, there are 14 episodes in the first season and this DVD only shows the first eight This is kind of annoying as the best episodes happen towards the end of the season I hope the BBC will release another DVD that contains all the episodes, but for now this one is still somewhat enjoyable,"," A Good Show, But I'm Kind of Annoyed  , ",3
42,Chennai," Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader) However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you,"," Not an \ultimate guide\, ",2
43,Chennai," What can I say? It works This helped me when applying to law schools A great guide to utilize Cutting a great score on the LSAT is just part of the equation to get into law school,"," It works, ",4
44,Chennai," If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!,"," Nothing you don't already know, ",1
45,Chennai," This looked like a great project for the kids and very cute and attractive The markers did not write on the hanger without wiping off and this was disappointing to the kids Great idea and set, just need markers that work for it,"," Door hanger review, ",3
46,Chennai," Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1 This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings A great book,"," Rochelle explains It All for You, ",5
47,Chennai," Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire timeI don't really care for the youth interviews, but I understand given the format of the original presentation I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussionsI'd recommend to anybody The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous \christian leaders\ today,"," Spreading a Passion for God, ",5

50,Chennai," As a recipe book, this isn't all that great The waffles are pretty good and the biscuits are enjoyable (especially with some whole wheat flour mixed in), but overall there aren't that many recipesI enjoyed the writing style and anecdotes, but I was hoping for more recipesOn the positive side, the author does not make the reader feel that using sourdough is difficult or mysterious, but makes it attainable for the novice,"," Good for what it is, ",3
51,Chennai," We purchased this book based on a recommendation to create our own sourdough \start\ The book is detailed and very informative We have enjoyed creating our own sourdough start It is amazing that you should leave the sourdough start on the counter for up to a year to have a stronger flavor,"," Alaska Sourdough Book Reivew, ",4
52,Chennai," My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD I tried several The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO I brought it back to the store for a refund I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it,"," Maybe I got a bad one, ",2
53,Chennai," I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk,"," TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS, ",1
54,Kerala," This TV is set so that it is not capable of a \recall\ function If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying,"," *** BEWARE ***, ",2

56,Kerala," The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents They are invaluable guides The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that,"," Dk Travel guides, ",5
57,Kerala," The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide,"," nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides, ",4
58,Kerala," I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!,"," Not the best, ",2
59,Kerala," This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary Also the book is heavy Is the book worth the money?

61,Kerala," The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures,"," Modern Traditional Point of View, ",4
62,Kerala," I have no quarrel with the book itself Wanted a copy for a long time However, I purchased a used book with the understanding that it was a \Signed Copy\ The copy I received WAS NOT autographed This is a disappointment If you advertise it as an autographed copy, don't substitute one that isn't Leaves me in serious doubt regarding furture purchases I'd appreciate some clarification Regards, Elmer Kurrus,"," Book is great - Purchase misleading !, ",4

65,Kerala," Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen,"," Scraped across the whole top, ",2

70,Kerala," This Rapunzel game was not really my favorite game It wasn't that much fun You have to wait a long time to move to another place And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at I would not recommend that you would buy this game I would rather play princess fashion boutique,"," Probably Won't Become Your Favorite Barbie Game, ",3
71,Kerala," I bought this software for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas She and her twin sister, along with their 4-year old sister, LOVE this game!!! They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a \fun\ game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time I think it was totally worth the money,"," very entertaining and worth the money, ",4
72,Kerala," My daughters have both enjoyed playing this game One of them is 6 yrs old and the other is 3 1/2 yrs old and they both have had no trouble mastering this game The down side to this game is that it is redundant/repeatitive It is the same things over and over again, only you can change the patterns and colors of the items you are working on In order to be able to play again after you have completed it, you must go and remove their name from the sign-in page 'then' retype it! This little chore is very annoying after awhile The graphics are very nice and colorful and it does allow your child to use her imagination and to be creative, but all in all , I think the game was way too pricey for what it is After having this in our house for 4 months, my girls have become rather bored with it,"," Over all, an okay game, ",3
73,Kerala," BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course,"," NYTimes Likes IT, ",5

78,Kerala," I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support This is a \must have\ CD for anyone who loves great piano playing The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too,"," Hamelin does it again, ",5

82,Kerala," As is the case with most adidas products I've owned, my 3-stripe fleece pants are made for style, fit, and durability They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California (not so for 85degree summer days, when I'll stash them away for cooler days to come) My size is somewhere between a medium and a large These adidas pants are amply cut, but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build A medium would probably be restrictive when I'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises This being said, I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon's superior service,"," Good value in gym wear, ",4

84,Kerala," I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their \rock\ debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their \2 Many DJs\ mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power Hopefully, \Nite Versions\ (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release \Nite Version\ on 12\ of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming \Sexor\ debut?,"," Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!, ",4

86,Kerala," 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull \classical\ 1980's style movie This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither I'd suggest skipping this movie,"," Slow dull \classical\ 1980's style movie, ",2

88,Kerala," Caution This album cover is almost exactly like the album cover for Deodato In Concert, which has different songs on it (it seems both albums have Do it Again and Spirit of Summer) If you're looking for Also Sprach Zarathustra, buy the other In Concert album (or Prelude) This album has Deodato on side 1, Airto on side 2(and I'm talking about the vinyl version, which I just bought at a thrift shop I'm not talking about the CD) Different bands on each side As for the musicit's OK I give it a 3 out of 5 stars Can't beat thrift shop price of $1 for vinyl albums,"," Don't be confused by album cover, ",3

98,Kerala," This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities!
